# ga-project-rpg-character-maker
This is my General Assembly final project (uses React.js)

Take note that this repository is an earlier version of the RPG Character Maker app that would be presented as part of my coursework at General Assembly. The last major commit to this specific repository was during the first week of December 2017. For the most up-to-date version of this app, please refer to the "project_four" repository.
